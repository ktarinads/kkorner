This is my new experience on writing my thoughts and ideas.

I've written many articles, blog posts, content in many platform like Medium, dev.to, custom blog and substack.

I feel they all lack something. They all sort your article in reverse cronological order.
The connection among many notes are not easy to find.
Ideas do not evolve in a cronological order, you need to go back and forth and iterate to refine them.
