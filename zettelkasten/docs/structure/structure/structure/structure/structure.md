You are probably wondering why the Structure note is inside so many structure.

"The paradox of structure is that, whatever its nature, any structure is both enabling and limiting at the same time"

You need to find the right balance of chaos and structure.

You should add more structure as you grow, as your company grows.

Try to avoid too much structure when it is not needed.

A few examples of too much structure

You decided to use all design patterns that you learned for an application of 1 endpoint.
You created 50 files instead of just 2.

You require 2 approvals for a pull request, even if it is a small change.

The more structure you add, the slower you move, more bureaucratic you become.

Do not create a new file if you have too few lines.
Do not create a new folder if you have a few files.
Do not create a complex review process if you have a small team.

Entropy will keep trying to add more and more structure, so you need to fight it.
