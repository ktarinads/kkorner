(from sseraphini)

When I come back to São Paulo to make my internship at PontoTel Startup.

I could live in my parents house at Guarulhs for "free"

It would only take me 2 hours to go to work and 2 hours to go back home.

I would lose 4 hours per day commuting, 20 hours per week and 80 hours per month. That's 960 hours per year.

I knew that my time was my precious resource, so I decided to buy it.

If you do basic math, I work 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, 4 weeks per month, that's 160 hours per month.
I was earning R$1500.00, so my hour was R$9.35. I was losing 80 hours * R$9.35 = R$748 per month.

I found a room to rent in São Paulo for R$400.00 and used these extra 4 hours to study and work a lot. 

All these 4 hours paid off a lot. I was able to work more, study more and learn more.
I was also going to happy hours and networking events, which helped me to meet a lot of people.
Additionally, I was able to create a tech community and find my co-founder for my own Startup.
